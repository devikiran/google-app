Font size is another disappointing factor that the font size is too many small even we couldn't read it out. 3. Auto refresh is another main problem. There is no auto refresh. Before it was very fantastic even on slow network. 4. Notification is not working. Make it much improved and effective. 5. Sharing the score on social site is not working. 6. Size of app is also greater and there is no any feedback menu. However, latest version has tried to bring some new appreciable change as follow: 1. Match coverage is expanded, i.e. you have tried to include non test playing nation and domestic event. It is one of the most exciting factor of new one. 2. More information on black screen view. It all happened on my Samsung galaxy Y smart phone. Please do it all. Thanks.</td> <td>2012-10-01</td>  <td>3.0</td> </tr><tr>

 <td>While accessing your registry, adding to it using the barcode "scanner," and watching reviews are all helpful, the execution is just plain terrible. Where to begin.. *Login - Does not remember username and password *Barcode scanner - Often fails to read *Registry - Does not show everything on your registry, and you cannot filter out (non)purchased items *Navigation - You have to go through several "buttons" to get to your registry. This app is advertised in store as the goto app for registering; why punish parents with painful procedures? (Power to the plosives!) It is a bad app, and users would be better suited with the in-store "gun" since it does all the same things in a more streamlined fashioned - and is much more effective at barcode reading and inventory lookup. The app creates more hassle than convenience and needs serious work.</td> <td>2012-10-07</td>  <td>2.0</td> </tr><tr>
